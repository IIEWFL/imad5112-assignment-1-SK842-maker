Project Overview

-
   
The *Meal Suggestor is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., provide a task management system, display weather forecasts, etc.].
                                                                                                                                                               
The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

App Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to randomly Suggest A meal and  a beverage based on the time period of that day. 

### Key Features:
 [ "UI Input of the Time Period for the Meal"]
 [ "UI Input of the Time Period for the Beverage"]
 [ "reccommendationMealButton"]
 [ "reccommendationBeverageButton"]
 [ "ResetButton"]

These features aim to provide  The User to have randomly suggested meal or beverage to have depending on the time period. This benifits the user by not having to struggle on what meal or beverage to have
throughout the course of the day. The Apps UI Inputs allow for the user to Enter any timePeriod in order for a meal or beverage to be randomly generated.
the 2 biggest features that play a vital role in intizilaizing the the running and functionality of the app are the two buttons for the recommendedMeal and Beverage.
Each of the buttons are initilized as private functions in order for the Processed information that was inputed in for the 1st two features to display an output answer for two of the text answers
suggested meal and suggested beverage.
The last Feature is the reset Button. The reset Button allows the user to Reset both the UI input and Processed aswers after Recommending a Meal or beverage.

4. Design Considerations
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Meal Suggestor app]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an Regular neat and concise UI that is Clear enough to Use for Everyday Use for the User.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it Will Run on Any Device that the application would be able to function on. Eliminating the idea of being Inaccessible on specific devices that require certain specifications of the device to run the App
for example - in order dor the meal suggestor app to run the devices interface has be able to not have any run time errors when the app is being launched on the device.
   
3. **Simplicity**:  The Meal suggestor apps design was developed in a way for the user to not allow the user to struggle in having to
think for themselves on what to eat or drink for that time period. Instead the Application Uses Colours for Both Of the Meal and Beverage Inputs and Output. 
   
4. **Performance**:  The Meal Suggestor App Installation Process conssits of a very short Launching time. due to the optimization of
the two private functions. Each of the functions contain  conditional loops of if and else functions witch act as Code blocks that assist in the management of resources and computer logic.



Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

```

Why:
----
- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

*Caption for screenshot 1: [Describe the context, e.g., "The home screen of the app showing the task list."]*

### Video Demo:
A video showcasing the app's functionality can be viewed here: [YouTube Video Link].

Why:
----
- Visuals like screenshots or a video link provide concrete evidence of the app’s functionality. This is an easy way for the reader to see what the app looks like and how it operates.


7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Trying to inizilize a Random function in the Meal list String With the Nested if function]
   - **Solution**: [I Asked Chat GPT how  the Radom function i wanted to Connect with the List of strings should look like]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

8. Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description, e.g., "Allowing users to set up reminders or notifications."]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description, e.g., "Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data."]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description, e.g., "Adding a dark mode option for better user experience."]


Why:
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
